# blogs-2023

Some of my security blogs/drafts I wrote in the Spring of 2023 for educating
(or just raising awareness) in some security-related aspects. They are incomplete,
biased, not completely accurate, and I would write them differently now. Here I keep them 
just for memories, hoping to polish and publish them later in a better form.
